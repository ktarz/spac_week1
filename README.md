# Specialisterne Academy week 1 - Data management

This repository is creating for the purpose of exercising simple data management techinques "taught" in the first week of Specialisterne Academy

## Description

This repo has 4 files which answers 4 different tasks given during the first week of specialisterne academy
- The first task is one that handles opening a file and doing some analysis and data cleaning
- The second task is one in which I handle a log_file and the errors it contains
- The third task is one in which the opening and preprocessing of a csv file is done
- The forth task is a introductionary task in the pandas library

## Getting started

## Version History

- 0.1
  - Initial release
 
## Personal challenges

I found certain parts of the hand-in difficult as I either didn't have any prior experience with the specific task - besides this my coding skills have been degrading during the past year.

The task I found the most difficult was task 3 as my experience with data cleaning without the use of pandas is extremely limited - to be honest none existing.
